# BetterLife
A userscript to improve the quality of your life. (Originally started as a joke for the 1st of April 2016)

The userscript modifies several websites so you can focus on doing what's important. No more distractions.

## Requirements
We've skipped feature detection, we'll leave it up to the user to research what (s)he's installing. We're a script meant for fun, not as a fully-featured platform with fallbacks.

Requires:

- localStorage ([Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage))

## Installation
- Firefox and related browsers: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
- Google Chrome, Chromium, and related browsers: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
- Opera (version 15 and later): [Tampermonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/) or [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey/).
- Opera version 12 and earlier [supports user scripts natively](http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/#writingscripts). [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) provides a friendlier UI and better compatibility.

## Websites
### Twitch.tv

- Removes Twitch.tv chat.

### Reddit

- Hides all child comments. Top comments will (usually) include the most important information for most threads, so this will remove irrelevant comments.
